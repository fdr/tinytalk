tinytalk
========

tinytalk is a use of double-boiler_ to experiment with what
interesting use cases neatly fit into one Heroku dyno.  It's basically
a (currently very slightly, and more so later) brushed up version of
the gevent_ webchat Django application.

Ultimately, I'd like to add a few neat features, including at least
one that'll exercise Celery_ for asynchronous job processing.
